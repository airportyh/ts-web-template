# ts-web-template

This is a bare-bones TypeScript web project template.

If you:

1. Like TypeScript (*TS*) or want to learn and/or experiment with TS.
2. Want to write code for the browser using TS.
3. Do not care to use a framework.

Then this template is perfect for you!!

## How to Use

1. Create a new directory for your web project.
2. Download the files from this template by clicking on the "Clone or download" green button,
then selecting "Download ZIP". *Downloading the ZIP is preferable to cloning this repository because
you don't want the history of this repository in your project.*
3. Extract the downloaded zip file and put the files into your newly created directory.
4. In your terminal, `cd` into your newly created directory, then run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`, then point your browser to the URL chosen by webpack-dev-server (usually `http://localhost:8080/`), and you are up and running.
6. You may want to remove the README.md file or replace it with your own project's content.
